### heyo!

I'm a ruby on rails developer working for a large healthtech company. Lately I've been working a lot within rails, but I also have experience with javascript, specifically the MERN stack, and a little bit of elixir. I've tinkered around with game development, but haven't built anything worth sharing yet.

I'm always interested in collaborating on cool new ideas or helping newer developers improve at their craft, if I can. Feel free to reach out and I'll get back to you as soon as possible!
