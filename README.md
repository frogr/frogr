### heyo!

I'm a ruby on rails developer. I recently started a hashnode blog, visible at blog.austn.net.

Lately I've been working a lot within rails, but I also have experience with javascript, specifically the MERN stack, and a little bit of elixir. I've tinkered around with game development, but haven't built anything worth sharing yet.

I love esports and other forms of competition. I believe that a masterful performance is always worth watching, regardless of the field it takes place in. I used to play League of Legends and Overwatch at a high level, and so I have a deep attachment to those worlds.

I'm always interested in collaborating on cool new ideas or helping newer developers improve at their craft, if I can. Feel free to reach out and I'll get back to you as soon as possible!
